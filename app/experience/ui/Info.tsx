          I dont have a long career, but I think its a good start. In
          my two-year career Ive worked at a startup, which was essential for
          me to learn a lot of things, and now I work for a large banking
          company.
        </p>
        <p>
          So far Ive met a lot of focused and dedicated people, with a lot of
          potential, from whom Ive learned and am learning every day, bosses
          and coworkers that Ill keep with me and with my evolution.
        </p>
        <p>
          I have a lot to learn and a lot of new people to meet, paths to
          follow, and a long market to get, I intend to leave Brazil at the
          end of my degree, and go to an international market, I dont know yet
          I want to go, but Im sure Ill do my best.
        </p>
        <p>
          Here are the companies Ive worked until now, all of them very good
          and essential to my development, where Ive made friends in all of
          them and have enormous affection.
